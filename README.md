# `Saga Protocol`
An open-source framework for general fitness

## How the idea came about ?

The idea is loosely inspired by two bodies of work - [Fabric by Daniel Messier](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) and [Blueprint by Bryan Johnson](https://protocol.bryanjohnson.com/#blueprint-starter-guide). As someone who was able to fix my own health without the guidance of a dietician or doctor directly by conducting my own research, I often get asked all manner of questions. I also see a lot of advice of all kind floating around which usually varies between having some sort of scientific basis to complete hocus pocus. Hence I thought of documenting my learnings, which worked for me in a simple, easy to understand way. 
The concepts listed here are applicable in a general to fitness in general which means they are NOT suggested for people who suffer from any specific health complication such as High BP, Diabetes, Thyroid etc. Please consult with a licensed nutritionist and doctor in such cases.

## How to use this repo ?

This repo is basically a [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) knowledge graph. You can consume the ideas individually directly from the repository as all notes are essentially in markdown format so can be viewed directly in Github. Or you can install Obsidian and use it to traverse the graph.
