Fitness is not a singular pursuit, you cannot excel by focusing only on one aspect of fitness. Here are some core aspects.

1. [[Hydration]]
2. [[Nutrition]]
3. [[Exercise]]
4. [[Rest / Recovery]] <== This is where I am now
5. [[Air]]

In my experience, its hard to multitask, you can context switch but not focus on everything all at once. So I focused on one aspect and slowly used habit stacking to run that aspect in maintenance mode so that I can move on to the next aspect. As of now my main focus is on Rest / Recovery.
