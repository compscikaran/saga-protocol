The body uses different sources of energy depending on how long you put strain on it. 
If you lift weights in shorter reps which last 30 seconds then take a break then you are primarily utilizing ATP stored within your muscles. 
If you are doing cardio continuously for 10-15 minutes your body is using Glycogen (Sugar) to provide energy by converting it to ATP. 
If you continue working out for more than 20 minutes then your fat stores are tapped into for creating ATP.

What does this mean ?

Lifting weights or doing high intensity cardio does NOTHING for fat loss (equate to weight loss). Both these activities are extremely imporant for general health but don't really affect your weight loss journey.

On the other hand walking / jogging for 1 - 1.5 hours does wonders because after 15-20 minutes your body starts utilizing stored fats which is exactly what we want. There is one condition here as well which is that for the stored fats to be mobilized into free fatty acids you need to be in a calorific deficit. If you have over excess of blood glucose then it will take much longer for the body to switch to burning stored fat post mobilization.
