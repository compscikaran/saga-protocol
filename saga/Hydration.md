I think most of us would have heard the timeless saying that 75% percent of our body is made of water. Well its not 75% really. A healthy figure is anywhere in the range - 
- **Men**: 50%–65%
- Women - 45%–60%
- Athletes - Up to 70% 

Every part of the body, cells, tissues, muscles, blood. 
- Water serves as the medium for transportation of oxygen and nutrients within the body via blood.
- Water also regulates body temperature
- Water plays the role of a solvent for ions like potassium, sodium, calcium etc. which provides the conduction for electric impulses from brain allowing us to move our body
- Water plays a key role in filtration process which occurs via osmosis in the kidneys. The wetter the kidneys are the more efficient the filtration process becomes. If kidneys are dehydrated then it puts load on liver which distracts the liver from its main job of metabolism

**How much water to Drink ?**

Water turnover rate is 3 - 4 %. If you have done a BCA or Dexa scan then you know the weight of water in your body and you can multiply it to get the amount of water you need to drink daily. 

On average this calculation comes out to 2.5 - 4 liter of water. This is how much at minimum you should consume

**How to ensure you drink enough water ?**

Build a habit. Be mindful, keep a 1L bottle with you and ensure you refill it 3-4 times atleast. Make it a ritual, maybe you get up every hour go for a quick stroll and fill up your bottle, you end up relaxing your eyes as well.
