How does food translate to energy ? Essentially this measurement is done by  using a proxy method. All macronutrients are broken down in the body during digestion and metabolization. E.g. when a protein is broken down all the chemical bonds between various molecules within the structure have to be broken down. Breaking of these bonds release a specific amount of energy and adding it all up gives us how much energy is provided to us by that food.
 
 **What is a Calorie**
 A unit of energy equivalent to the heat energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 Â°C

**How much Calories do different types of foods have**

Food is basically composed of various macronutrient constituents. To calculate how much calories a food has we have to 
1. Figure out how much quantity in grams of each macronutrient is present in our food. 
2. Multiple each macronutrient quantity with its caloric factor (How much calories 1 gram of that substance provides us as energy)
3. Add everything up

**Caloric Factors of Different Nutrients**

Protein = 4 calories
Carbohydrates = 4 calories
Fat = 9 calories
Fibre = Some people consider as 2 calories and some as 0. 

NOTE: Micronutrients like Vitamins don't have caloric factors because they are in such small quantities that the energy they produce is insignificant and is usually ignored
