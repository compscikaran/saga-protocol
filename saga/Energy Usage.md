Perhaps the biggest myth I see floating around is that you don't have to control your eating you just burn off the extra calories in the gym or running or something. Below picture best explains how energy is used up in your body.

Well this is confusing. Lots of complicated acronyms so lets break these down

Firstly the diagram shows the breakdown of how much percentage of energy used by your body is in which area. Hence the total lines up to 100 % and so its not an absolute figure. The exact number of calories burnt by your body in a day varies from day to day as well as person to person depending on a lot of different factors such as weight, height, fat percentage, muscle mass, activity level etc.

**Lets understand the various acronyms here -** 
1. BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) - Its the energy your body needs to stay alive. If you did nothing just lied down on your bed the whole day this is the number of calories your body would burn
2. NEAT (Non Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) - Energy used up in activities that cannot be classified as "exercise" e.g. Walking, standing up and sitting down, waving hands while talking, fidgeting, cleaning etc.
3. TEF (Thermic effect of Food) - Energy is infact also used while digesting food, converting food into energy. Each type of macronutrient has its own TEF factor which is a percentage representing how much of the energy of the food is actually used in digesting itself. E.g. TEF of protein is 20% which means 20 - 30% of calories provided by the protein you eat get used up in digesting and metabolizing itself.
4. EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) - The most obvious one here is that energy is used up while exercising. As we have seen walking doesn't count so what does count ? Check out the section on Exercise for more details.

**Key Takeaways**
- BMR is the biggest contributor of energy expenditure far outweighing all other areas
- Digestion and Non-exercise activities contribute use up just as much or even more energy compared to actual exercise
- While this graph is flexible (the percentages can vary day to day) so you can burn off extra calories by exercising little bit more. But, the stretchability has some restrictions and if you push too hard on exercise then your body is smart enough that it reduces your BMR using much less energy while resting.
